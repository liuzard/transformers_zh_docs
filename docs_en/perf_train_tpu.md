# Training on TPUs

<Tip>

 Note: Most of the strategies introduced in the [single GPU section](perf_train_gpu_one) (such as mixed precision training or gradient accumulation) and [multi-GPU section](perf_train_gpu_many) are generic and apply to training models in general so make sure to have a look at it before diving into this section.

</Tip>

This document will be completed soon with information on how to train on TPUs.
