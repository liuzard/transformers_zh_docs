# Wav2Vec2-Conformer

## Overview

The Wav2Vec2-Conformer was added to an updated version of [fairseq S2T: Fast Speech-to-Text Modeling with fairseq](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05171) by Changhan Wang, Yun Tang, Xutai Ma, Anne Wu, Sravya Popuri, Dmytro Okhonko, Juan Pino.

The official results of the model can be found in Table 3 and Table 4 of the paper.

The Wav2Vec2-Conformer weights were released by the Meta AI team within the [Fairseq library](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/blob/main/examples/wav2vec/README.md#pre-trained-models).

Tips:

- Wav2Vec2-Conformer follows the same architecture as Wav2Vec2, but replaces the *Attention*-block with a *Conformer*-block
  as introduced in [Conformer: Convolution-augmented Transformer for Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08100).
- For the same number of layers, Wav2Vec2-Conformer requires more parameters than Wav2Vec2, but also yields 
an improved word error rate.
- Wav2Vec2-Conformer uses the same tokenizer and feature extractor as Wav2Vec2.
- Wav2Vec2-Conformer can use either no relative position embeddings, Transformer-XL-like position embeddings, or
  rotary position embeddings by setting the correct `config.position_embeddings_type`.

This model was contributed by [patrickvonplaten](https://huggingface.co/patrickvonplaten).
