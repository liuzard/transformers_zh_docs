# Llama2

## Overview

The Llama2 model was proposed in [LLaMA: Open Foundation and Fine-Tuned Chat Models](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/llama-2-open-foundation-and-fine-tuned-chat-models/) by Hugo Touvron, Louis Martin, Kevin Stone, Peter Albert, Amjad Almahairi, Yasmine Babaei, Nikolay Bashlykov, Soumya Batra, Prajjwal Bhargava, Shruti Bhosale, Dan Bikel, Lukas Blecher, Cristian Canton Ferrer, Moya Chen, Guillem Cucurull, David Esiobu, Jude Fernandes, Jeremy Fu, Wenyin Fu, Brian Fuller, Cynthia Gao, Vedanuj Goswami, Naman Goyal, Anthony Hartshorn, Saghar Hosseini, Rui Hou, Hakan Inan, Marcin Kardas, Viktor Kerkez Madian Khabsa, Isabel Kloumann, Artem Korenev, Punit Singh Koura, Marie-Anne Lachaux, Thibaut Lavril, Jenya Lee, Diana Liskovich, Yinghai Lu, Yuning Mao, Xavier Martinet, Todor Mihaylov, Pushka rMishra, Igor Molybog, Yixin Nie, Andrew Poulton, Jeremy Reizenstein, Rashi Rungta, Kalyan Saladi, Alan Schelten, Ruan Silva, Eric Michael Smith, Ranjan Subramanian, Xiaoqing EllenTan, Binh Tang, Ross Taylor, Adina Williams, Jian Xiang Kuan, Puxin Xu, Zheng Yan, Iliyan Zarov, Yuchen Zhang, Angela Fan, Melanie Kambadur, Sharan Narang, Aurelien Rodriguez, Robert Stojnic, Sergey Edunov, Thomas Scialom. It is a collection of foundation language models ranging from 7B to 70B parameters, with checkpoints finetuned for chat application!

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*In this work, we develop and release Llama 2, a collection of pretrained and fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) ranging in scale from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. Our fine-tuned LLMs, called Llama 2-Chat, are optimized for dialogue use cases. Our models outperform open-source chat models on most benchmarks we tested, and based on our human evaluations for helpfulness and safety, may be a suitable substitute for closed-source models. We provide a detailed description of our approach to fine-tuning and safety improvements of Llama 2-Chat in order to enable the community to build on our work and contribute to the responsible development of LLMs.*

<Tip warning={true}>

The `Llama2` models were trained using `bfloat16`, but the original inference uses `float16. The checkpoints uploaded on the hub use `torch_dtype = 'float16'` which will be
used by the `AutoModel` API to cast the checkpoints from `torch.float32` to `torch.float16`. 

The `dtype` of the online weights is mostly irrelevant, unless you are using `torch_dtype="auto"` when initializing a model using `model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("path", torch_dtype = "auto")`. The reason is that the model will first be downloaded ( using the `dtype` of the checkpoints online) then it will be casted to the default `dtype` of `torch` (becomes `torch.float32`) and finally, if there is a `torch_dtype` provided in the config, it will be used. 

Training the model in `float16` is not recommended and known to produce `nan`, as such the model should be trained in `bfloat16`.

</Tip>

Tips:

- Weights for the Llama2 models can be obtained by filling out [this form](https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/)
- The architecture is very similar to the first Llama, with the addition of Grouped Query Attention (GQA) following this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13245.pdf)
- Setting `config.pretraining_tp` to a value different than 1 will activate the more accurate but slower computation of the linear layers, which should better match the original logits.
- The original model uses `pad_id = -1` which means that there is no padding token. We can't have the same logic, make sure to add a padding token using `tokenizer.add_special_tokens({"pad_token":"<pad>"})` and resize the token embedding accordingly. You should also set the `model.config.pad_token_id`. The `embed_tokens` layer of the model is initialized with `self.embed_tokens = nn.Embedding(config.vocab_size, config.hidden_size, self.config.padding_idx)`, which makes sure that encoding the padding token will output zeros, so passing it when initializing is recommended.
- After filling out the form and gaining access to the model checkpoints, you should be able to use the already converted checkpoints. Otherwise, if you are converting your own model, feel free to use the [conversion script](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/models/llama/convert_llama_weights_to_hf.py). The script can be called with the following (example) command:

```bash
python src/transformers/models/llama/convert_llama_weights_to_hf.py \
    --input_dir /path/to/downloaded/llama/weights --model_size 7B --output_dir /output/path
```

- After conversion, the model and tokenizer can be loaded via:

```python
from transformers import LlamaForCausalLM, LlamaTokenizer

tokenizer = LlamaTokenizer.from_pretrained("/output/path")
model = LlamaForCausalLM.from_pretrained("/output/path")
```

Note that executing the script requires enough CPU RAM to host the whole model in float16 precision (even if the biggest versions
come in several checkpoints they each contain a part of each weight of the model, so we need to load them all in RAM). For the 75B model, it's thus 145GB of RAM needed.

- The LLaMA tokenizer is a BPE model based on [sentencepiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece). One quirk of sentencepiece is that when decoding a sequence, if the first token is the start of the word (e.g. "Banana"), the tokenizer does not prepend the prefix space to the string.

This model was contributed by [Arthur Zucker](https://huggingface.co/ArthurZ) with contributions from [Lysandre Debut](https://huggingface.co/lysandre). The code of the implementation in Hugging Face is based on GPT-NeoX [here](https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neox). The original code of the authors can be found [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama).
